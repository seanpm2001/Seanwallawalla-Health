## Listing

Only 2 repositories are from this era:

- [:octocat: `SNU 2D Health`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_Health/)
- [:octocat: `SNU 2D Health / Extras / Birdbumps`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_Health_Extra_Birdbumps/)

## Swiss flag

The flag of Switzerland `üá®üá≠Ô∏è` is used for this project, as it is the closest I could get to a medkit or a red cross.

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanwallawalla-health/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

## Take the hippocratic oath


![Hippocrates.jpg](/Hippocrates.jpg)

The Hippocratic oath is an oath everyone must take before performing medicine.

English version (translated by a linguist expert (William Henry Samuel Jones, or W.H.S. Jones) not a machine)

```english
    I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.

    To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the Healer‚Äôs oath, but to nobody else.

    I will use those dietary regimens which will benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment, and I will do no harm or injustice to them. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even, verily, on sufferers from stone, but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.

    Into whatsoever houses I enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain from all intentional wrong-doing and harm, especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman, bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my profession, as well as outside my profession in my intercourse with men, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets.

    Now if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain for ever reputation among all men for my life and for my art; but if I break it and forswear myself, may the opposite befall me. ‚Äì Translation by W.H.S. Jones.
```

# Organization description

My organization for health projects. I am committed to promoting open source, functional, and life saving medical software.

**The part that was cut off:**

Legal notice: due to Red Cross logo restrictions, I used the Swiss (üá®üá≠ Switzerland) flag instead. The Red Cross/Red Crescent movement is known to be abusive when it come to their logo (which is just an inverted version of the flag of üá®üá≠ Switzerland, or üáπüá∑ Turkey. Other than that, the Red Cross/crescent movement is good) Also: my health software is designed to help, but it isn't 100% accurate and isn't a 100% guarantee in saving a life.

***
```

### Core projects

Core projects for this organization include:

1. [Medical/Medicinal ethics](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Medicinal-ethics/) - This project goes over the standard rules and ethics of producing and using medical software and equipment.

2. [Organization info](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHub_Organization_Info/) - This project is a database of all my organizations, including the ones listed in the current one you are reading from.

3. [Website trunk](https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-health/Seanwallawalla-health.github.io/) - This project is the trunk for the website you are currently reading.

No other core (as of 2021 Tuesday September 7th)

### Templates in use

These are the templates this organization is using:

1. [Template GitHub Pages Default V7](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Template_GitHubPages_Default_V7) [Organization link](https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-health/Template_GitHubPages_Default_V7/) - This template is used for constructing the website you are currently reading.

### Snapcraft

There will be no snapcraft versions available for these medical software pieces, except for [code distancing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-Distancing/) which is a humor project.

# Medicinal ethics

## Software

Software support should be as ethical as possible and there should be a way to pull the plug on a project without causing the hospital to go down. You should wait until as many hospitals and medical centers migrate first before you even think of pulling the plug.

Software must go through a thorough development cycle, and must be made as stable as possible before sending out a candidate. The candidate has to be reliable, the cost of error is human life. Test the software for at least 3 months straight first.

### Hacking

Hacking a hospital is highly unethical, and should be considered a war crime.

No one should condone hacking a hospital.

### Spyware

In no way should hospital software EVER contain spyware or ransomware. This includes even going down to the level of basic analytics and collecting more than 1 byte of data per patient without it going into the patients records.

### Operating system

Please keep your hospital computers up to date. For Windows devices, it should always have some sort of security support. This means you shouldn't use normal Windows XP after 2014, and you shouldn't use any variant of Windows XP after 2019, you shouldn't use Windos Vista after 2019, and so on.

If you are a Linux based hospital, you don't have to be as worried, but made sure not to fall back more than 2 major kernel releases (in example, when Linux kernel 6 comes out, you shouldn't be using Linux kernel 4 anymore)

If you plan to run MacOS at a hospital, you don't have to be as worried as if running Windows, but you still shouldn't fall more than 4 years behind.

## Hardware

### Maintenance

A hospital should be kept up to date, no matter the cost. When should a hospital upgrade? At least once every 5-10 years.

## Property

A hospital should not be bombed or destroyed in a combative conflict. This is a war crime.

**This list needs updates**

### Legal

My health software is licensed under the GNU General Public License V3. There are some additional terms that need to be addressed:

* This software cannot be modified to be used in proprietary works - This software cannot be bundled with closed source/proprietary software, even if the closed source software has some open source components. This doesn't mean that the software can't be run on proprietary systems, such as Window 10 or MacOS. My medical works also cannot be sold for a profit (unless it is hardware) if you are selling my medical software for even a fraction of a penny, you are violating the license agreement and are scamming people.

* This software comes without a warranty - As much as I want to help people with their health, I can't guarantee that it will be 100% effective (although I aim for at least 95% effectiveness) Defective software situations should be reported. For safety, make sure to run a stable release that you trust. Don't always jump to the latest version, wait a bit first for testing to be done, so that it is safe for your patients.

* The use of the Switzerland flag was done to avoid being sued by the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, as they are aggressive when it comes towards use of their logo. Since their logo is just an inverted version of the flag of Switzerland, I used a detail image of the Swiss flag.

### 2021 September

I was motivated to continue working on medical software this month, as I have made it a second goal for this month to work on improving the medical sector, as some of its software problems are becoming beyond ridiculous. 

![Electroencephalograph_Neurovisor-BMM_40_(close_view).jpg](/Electroencephalograph_Neurovisor-BMM_40_(close_view).jpg)

This was inspired by the fact that so many hospitals still rely on Windows XP (all support ended in 2019) and extremely old and outdated medical software that for whatever reason can't work on Windows Vista or newer/Linux 4 or newer (looking at EEGLAB, which is the top EEG software hospitals use and also hasn't been updated in ~15 years (since 2006)) I aim to make medical software and medical industries better this month by getting back into the development of medical software, either directly or indirectly.

I know it is expensive to upgrade equipment, but it is entirely necessary. I would NEVER condone hacking a hospital, but there are some messed up people that would. This is why we need to take efforts into increasing hospital security.

I have 2 family members that work at a hospital, and I am able to get info on the issue easier this way. I know that software hospital in the US has to be HIPAA compliant, which I feel will be an easy goal. Work will also continue on this project after the month ends, no plugs will be pulled.

## History

This is a category project and doesn't have much history. Its projects contain additional history that is not listed here.

### Pre-history

This organization category was created on 2021 February 26th. It received minimal work, and mostly received forks.

### Alpha history

On 2021 June 9th, the [Seanpm2001-health](https://github.com/Seanpm2001-Health/) was launched, which contains the same projects as the original ([Seanwallawalla-health](https://github.com/Seanwallawalla-health/)) but also contains additional articles and documentation that wouldn't fit in the purely medical project portal.

This project began receiving updates again in early 2021 September, and on 2021 September 7th, the project received its own website.

### Beta history

No Beta history to show for this project.

### Modern history

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
